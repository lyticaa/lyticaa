### Linter

To run the linter:

```bash
make lint
```

### Tests

To run the tests and see test coverage:

```bash
make tests
```

### Install

To compile and install the binaries:

```bash
make install
```

### Run the Web App

The web app will require active Redis and Postgres instances. See below for how to start these. 

```bash
make run-web-service
```

The web app will then be accessible on http://localhost:3000.

### Run the Worker

```bash
make run-worker-service
```

The worker will then connect to RabbitMQ and listen for any incoming messages to process. You will need to ensure a local RabbitMQ instance is running (see below for how to start RabbitMQ).

## Sessions

Session data is stored in Redis. To start a local Redis instance, run:

```bash
make docker-redis
```

## Cache

Memcache is used to cache frequently requested objects. To start a local Memcache instance, run:

```bash
make docker-memcache
```

## Database

This project makes use of Postgres.

### Setup

To start a local Postgres instance, run:

```bash
make docker-pg
```

Then, to create the database and apply the correct role:

```bash
make create-database
make create-user
```

### Migrations

Add your migrations to the `db/migrations` folder. To apply the migrations:

```bash
make migrate
```

## Messaging

To communicate with other applications in the Lyticaa network, we use RabbitMQ.

To start a local RabbitMQ instance, run:

```bash
make docker-rabbitmq
```
